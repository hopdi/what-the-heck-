# **WHAT THE HECK?**

## Have a basic understanding of blockchain in 30 minutes

<div style="text-align: justify">

A lot of people think of blockchain as a place where to make ***money***. To some, blockchain
is bitcoin, ethereum or any cryptocurrency. The truth is bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency is not what
blockchain is all about. Alot of people keep buying and selling cryptocurrency thinking its blockchain; in
other words many are _ignorant_ of what blockchain really is.

The OS you use is called an OS because it manages all resources and task on the hardware device you use, been
it smartphones, PC, television etc. Take for instance windows operating system, it manages user request into
the user interface and all task\[I have no intension to use technical terms here\]. Alot of technical geeks
define blockchain as a shared digital ledger, while some define it as a digital decentralized[no financial
institutions involved] and distributed ledger. But what is a ledger and other technical words? That is the gap
am here to fit into. *When you're done reading this text, you will stop looking at blockchain as ~~where to make money~~,
but rather a technology everybody should embrace.*

__SEE ledger as transaction and a block as a transaction with \[talk on that as we proceed\].__

## SO, WHAT THE HECK IS BLOCKCHAIN?

Blockchain is just like the operating system you use on your mobile phones, PC, etc. It connects you to its
network \[when you have need of it\]. TAKE NOTE OF "when you have need of it", that actually tells you that it's
up to you to know what you want; just as you\[a node\] may be using MSoffice on windows operating system, another
node\[PC or hardware with windows installed on it\] user may be playing need for speed and another node may be
online. That shows different functions been served on thesame OS\[NOTE: it's not on thesame PC but thesame OS\].
That is to say every PC could have a copy of thesame OS with dissimilar. Now, relating that to blockchain, say
you have a copy of Bitcoin or Ethereum peer-to-peer files, connecting the PC to bitcoin core client creates and
activate a node\[The nodes or peers are machines that maintain the transactions and records on the blockchain
network\].

Blockchain consist of layers which are:
+ Application layer.
+ Execution layer.
+ Semantic layer.
+ Propagation layer.
+ Consensus layer.

1. The application layer is where end users gain access and interacts with the network.

2. The execution layer is where the instructions ordered by the application layer are processed on all the
nodes in a blockchain network.

3. The semantic layer takes care of how new blocks relate to previous blocks and provides the protocol for
verifying the consensus rules\[we will see consensus rules shortly\].

4. The propagation layer is responsible for deciding how transactions are handled on the network. Check
blockchain white papers for a detail understanding of this layer.

5. The consensus layer is the base layer for most of the blockchain systems. The sole aim of this layer is
to get all the nodes to agree on one consistent state of work\[transaction or ledger\]. This is achieved by
the known consensus rules which includes:
    - Proof of work (PoW).
	- Proof of stake (PoS).
	- Delegated proof of stake (DPoS).

1. **PoW** - PoW is the first and most popular mechanism; PoW is achieved by having a network of miners and
presenting the miners with a mathematical problem. When the miners solve the problem, they are
rewarded with a cryptocurrency. The reward is the proof of the work checked\[done\], and thatâ€™s
where the name comes from. Now you can see that, this is all about hardwork, its here that
miners are been spoken of. PoW have its own limitations. In other to be part of PoW, you need a
hardware with a good computing power\[hash rate\], high electricity supply, fast internet
connectivity among others.

2. **PoS** - PoS relies on how many coins a peer holds. The peer needs to stake the number of coins it wants
to mine. Instead of hashing power, we have stake power, and there is no dependency on energy
consumption because there is no mathamatical problems to solve and power consumption. A network
fee is provided to peers instead of giving a reward for solving a mathematical problem as in PoW.

3. **DPoS** - DPoS is done in this manner:

   - **Election**: this is simply to elect group of block producers. When electing a group of
block producers, there are restrictions as to the number[about 21] of block producers
instead of unlimited as with PoW.
   - **Scheduling production**: this is simply assigning block producers time to produce a block
on the blochchain network. Each one of the block producers takes turns to produce a block
every 3 seconds.

Therefore by creating a node, the network\[blockchain\] is been managed by you and I. Each cryptocurrency has
its own blockchain and nodes.
