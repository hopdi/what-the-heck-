<p><b>PoS</b> - PoS relies on how many coins a peer holds. The peer needs to stake the number of coins it wants to mine. Instead of hashing power, we have stake power, and there is no dependency on energy consumption because there is no mathamatical problems to solve and power consumption. A network fee is provided to peers instead of giving a reward for solving a mathematical problem as in PoW.</p>
<p><b>DPoS</b> - DPoS is done in this manner:</p>
<p>	- <b>Election</b>: this is simply to elect 	group of block producers. When electing a group of block producers, there are restrictions as to the number[about 21] of block producers instead of unlimited as with PoW.</p>
<p>	- <b>Scheduling production:</b> this is simply assigning block producers time to produce a block on the blochchain network. Each one of the block producers takes turns to produce a block every 3 seconds.</p>
<p>	Therefore by creating a node, the network[blockchain] is been managed by you and I. Each cryptocurrency has its own blockchain and nodes.</p>
