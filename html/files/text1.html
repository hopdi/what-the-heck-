<p>	A lot of people think of blockchain as a place where digital currencies are gotten. To some, blockchain is bitcoin, ethereum or any cryptocurrency. The truth is bitcoin and any other cryptocurrency is not what blockchain is all about. Alot of people keep buying and selling cryptocurrency thinking its blockchain; in other words many are ignorant of what blockchain really is. </p>
<p>	The OS you use is called an OS because it manages all resources and task on the hardware device you use, been it smartphones, PC, television etc. Take for instance windows operating system, it manages user request into the user interface and all task[I have no intension to use technical terms here]. Alot of technical geeks define blockchain as a shared digital ledger, while some define it as a digital decentralized[no financial institutions involved] and distributed ledger. But what is a ledger and other technical words? That is the gap am here to fit into.</p>
