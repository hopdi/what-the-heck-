<p>The <b>consensus layer</b> is the base layer for most of the blockchain systems. The sole aim of this layer is to get all the nodes to agree on one consistent state of work[transaction or ledger]. This is achieved by the known consensus rules which includes:</p>
<p>	– Proof of work (PoW).</p>
<p>	– Proof of stake (PoS).</p>
<p>	– Delegated proof of stake (DPoS).</p>
<p><b>PoW</b> - PoW is the first and most popular mechanism; PoW is achieved by having a network of miners and presenting the miners with a mathematical problem. When the miners solve the problem, they are rewarded with a cryptocurrency. The reward is the [proof of the work] checked[done], and that’s where the name comes from. Now you can see that, this is all about hardwork, its here that miners are been spoken of. PoW have its own limitations. In other to be part of PoW, you need a hardware with a good computing power[hash rate], high electricity supply, fast internet connectivity among others.</p>
