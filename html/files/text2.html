<p>SEE ledger as transaction and a block as a transaction with success[talk on that as we proceed].</p>
<p><b>SO, WHAT THE HECK IS BLOCKCHAIN?</b></p>
<p>	Blockchain is just like the operating system you use on your mobile phones, PC, etc. It connects you to its network [when you have need of it]. TAKE NOTE OF &quot;when you have need of it&quot;, that actually tells you that it's up to you to know what you want; just as you[a node] may be using MSoffice on windows operating system, another node[PC or hardware with windows installed on it] user may be playing need for speed and another node may be online. That shows different functions been served on thesame OS[NOTE: it's not on thesame PC but thesame OS]. That is to say every PC could have a copy of thesame OS with dissimilar. Now, relating that to blockchain, say you have a copy of Bitcoin or Ethereum peer-to-peer files, connecting the PC to bitcoin core client creates and </p>
<p>activate a node[The nodes or peers are machines that maintain the transactions and records on the blockchain network].</p>
